# Page Text Processor

> Disclaimer: I did not write this code, in fact I have no understanding of JavaScript.

Out of curiosity, I started looking for a free API from Llama models and came across the OpenRouter site. After that, I decided to write a Chrome browser extension that would extract the text of a web page and, if necessary, translate or summarize it into Persian, or do both the translation and the summary at the same time, and if necessary, save the original text along with the processed text in the form of a markdown file.

As I said, I have no ability in JavaScript, so I turned to the AI ​​claud to create this extension.

The reason for publishing this extension on my GitHub is simply to share my experience. Otherwise, I had no involvement in the creation of this extension and still do not.
